title :  How to install pycharm

Am taking a new Programming language.
Like most people trying new stuff, I headed over to YouTube for some tutorials.
I went searched for Derek Banas videos on python (someone recommended him). He then proceeded to mention he prefers using Pycharm and had a demo
on how to install it, however he just covered the Windows and Mac installations and no mention of how to do it for the Linux users.
Am running on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit. So I headed over to the Pycharm Website and downloaded it.
Then came the installation, at first I tried the good old habit of "right click", then "open with Ubuntu Software Center".....
When installing Brackets and Opera browser the above method had worked, but on this one, it failed. So I looked at the documentation on Pycharm site, wasn't as clear as I hoped considering I've been on Ubuntu just for under 3 months now.
I remembered a simple way I came across while installing Netbeans, I combined it with the steps on Pycharm site and it worked!
Disclaimer: probably there a better way out there, but here are my few steps.


| Instructions |
| ------------- |
| Copy the pycharm-community.tar.gz to the desired installation location, preferably new empty directory. Make sure you have read-write permissions for that directory. |
| Right click and extract it. | 
| Press the Window button , type  Terminal |
| The terminal will open, navigate to the destination that you created in step 1. |
| In side the extracted folder there's a bin folder, and inside it there is this~> pycharm.sh. |
| type this chmod +x pycharm.sh |
| Type this ./pycharm.sh |


The rest is child"s play, just "click next".."click next"
