Am taking a new Programming language. Its a requirement at the boot-camp.
like most people tring new stuff, i headed over to YouTube to get some tutorials vids in order to get a feel of things.
I went straight for Derek Banas vids on python....someone recommended him. He then proceeded to mention he prefers using Pycharm and had a demo
on how to install it, however he just covered the Windows and Mac installations and no mention of how to do it for the linux users.
Am running on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit. So i headed over to the Pycharm Website and downloaded it.
Then came the installation, at first i tried the good old habit i of "right click", then "open with Ubuntu Software Center".....
When installing Brackets and Opera browser the above method had worked, but on this one, it failed. so i looked at the documentation on Pycharm site, wasn't as clear as i hoped considering ive been on ubuntu just for under 3 months now.
I remembered a simple way i came across while installing Netbeans, i combined it with the steps on Pycharm site and it worked!
Disclaimer: probably there a better way out there, but here are my few steps.

1. Copy the pycharm-community*.tar.gz to the desired installation location, preferably new empty directory. Make sure you have read-write permissions for that directory.
2. Right click and extract it.
3. Press the Window button , type this~> terminal
4. The terminal will open, navigate to the destination that you created in step 1.
5. In side the extracted folder there's a bin folder, and inside it there is this~> pycharm.sh.
6. type this ~>chmod +x <installer-file-name>
