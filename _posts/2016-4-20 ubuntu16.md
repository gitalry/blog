title: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is coming
---
So, Ubuntu 16 is hitting the streets tomorrow, and unlike its predecessor 15.10, is will be a LTS(long term support) meaning Canonical will support it for the next 5 years.
The question on your mind is "do I really need an upgrade right now?" A word of advice from omgubuntu goes like this...."If your current system is ticking along nicely ask yourself if you really need to rock the boat. If stability matters more than shiny new features, you can always wait a few months for the (inevitable) early kinks to get worked out and upgrade then."
Personally I've decided to take the advice and not upgrade right away. However I'll grab me an ISO image and keep it for a rainy day.
There are a few steps to take as you undertake the journey, *these guys got you covered.~>* [http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-14-04-to-ubuntu-16-04-lts]
GOODLUCK!
