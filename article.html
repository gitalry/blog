                    <h2>WhatsApp introduces end-to-end encryption</h2>
                    <p>What is encryption?</p>
                    <p>
                        The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it .The most well-known instance of the latter category is a February 2016 court case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The FBI wanted Apple to create and electronically sign new software that would enable the FBI to unlock a work-issued iphone it recovered from one of the shooters in a terrorist attack in Dec 2015 in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people and injured 22. The two attackers later died in a shootout with police; the phone was recovered intact, but that phone was locked with a four-digit password and was set to eliminate all its data after ten failed password attempts.</p>
                    <p>
                        On February 9, 2016, the FBI announced that it was unable to unlock the county-owned phone it recovered, due to its advanced security features, including encryption of user data. As a result, the FBI asked Apple Inc. to create a new version of the phone's iOS Operating System that could be installed and run in the phone's radon access memory to disable certain security features that Apple refers to as "GovtOS". Apple declined due to its policy to never undermine the security features of its products. The FBI responded by going to court but thats a whole can of worms </p>
                    <p>
                        Now most of us in the last year or so have become conversant with the use of WhatsApp- a Messenger is a cross-platform mobile messaging app which allows you to exchange messages without having to pay for SMS.....blah blah, any way, last week on 5th April</p>
                    <p>
                        WhatsApp announced that it was rolling out an end to end encryption to its platform. Even the company would be unable to decrypt users' communications. Amnesty International and security professionals praised the move; the US Federal Bureau of Investigation criticized it as threatening the work of law enforcement .</p>
                    <p>
                        Now this was quite a reveal coming hot in the heals of the “FBI vs Apple saga”, but lets look at the advantage of this development. The biggest advantage here is that your communication is protected from unauthorized access. WhatsApp also took a swing at the law enforcement agencies that attempt to subvert this developments and I quote them “Encryption is one of the most important tools governments, companies, and individuals have to promote safety and security in the new digital age. Recently there has been a lot of discussion about encrypted services and the work of law enforcement. While we recognize the important work of law enforcement in keeping people safe, efforts to weaken encryption risk exposing people's information to abuse from cybercriminals, hackers, and rogue states.”</p>
                    <p>
                        However, whatever side of discussion you lean towards, this encryption thing is here to stay thankfully, so if you haven't seen some notification in your chats informing you of the encryption, just visit the official WhatsApp page and get yourself an update of the app and you're good to go!</p>
                    <p>
                        Today more than a billion people are using WhatsApp to stay in touch with their friends and family all over the world. And now, every single one of those people can talk freely and securely on WhatsApp.</p>
